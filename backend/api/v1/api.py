"""
backend.api.v1.api
------------------
This module defines the main API router for version 1 of the MOSS backend API.

It aggregates various endpoint routers responsible for specific functionalities
like ingestion, retrieval, surfacing, search, etc., making them accessible
under the `/api/v1` prefix (as configured in the main application setup).
