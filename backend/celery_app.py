backend.celery_app
------------------

Configures and initializes the Celery application instance used for background task
processing within the MOSS backend.

This module handles:
- Celery application setup with broker and backend URLs from settings.
- Integration with the application's custom logging configuration, ensuring
  Celery workers use the same logging setup (including process-safe file rotation).
- Disabling Celery's default logging handlers to prevent conflicts.
- Specifying task discovery locations.
- Defining default Celery configuration settings.
