        Creates a new affiliation record or updates an existing one based on the composite PK.

        This method implements an "upsert" logic for affiliation records.
        1. It first attempts to `get_affiliation` using the composite key elements.
        2. If an existing record is found:
           - It updates the `confidence_score`, `evidence`, `parameters_used`.
           - Crucially, it also updates the `calculated_at` timestamp to reflect
             when this latest calculation/update occurred.
        3. If no existing record is found:
           - It creates a new `RepositoryInstitutionAffiliation` instance with all
             provided data, including the current timestamp for `calculated_at`.
        4. Adds the new or updated object to the session and flushes the session.
           Flushing sends the SQL (INSERT or UPDATE) to the DB and checks constraints.
        5. Refreshes the object state from the database after flushing.

        Important:
        - Does NOT commit the transaction; the caller is responsible for commit/rollback.
        - Manually sets the `calculated_at` timestamp on both create and update.
          If the model used `server_default=func.now()`, refresh might handle it,
          but explicit setting ensures consistency.

        Args:
            repository_id: ID of the Repository.
            institution_id: ID of the Institution.
            algorithm_name: Name of the affiliation algorithm.
            algorithm_version: Version of the affiliation algorithm.
            confidence_score: The calculated confidence score for this affiliation.
            evidence: Optional JSON-serializable dictionary detailing the evidence found.
            parameters_used: Optional JSON-serializable dictionary of algorithm parameters used.

        Returns:
            A tuple containing:
                - The created or updated RepositoryInstitutionAffiliation object (flushed and refreshed).
                - A boolean: `True` if a new record was created, `False` if an existing record was updated.

        Raises:
            SQLAlchemyError: If any database operation (get, add, flush, refresh) fails.
