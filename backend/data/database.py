"""
backend.data.database
---------------------
This module configures and provides access to the application's database
using SQLAlchemy. It sets up the database engine, session management,
and the declarative base class for ORM models. It also includes a
dependency function (`get_db`) for use with web frameworks like FastAPI.

# Create a base class for our ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) models.

def get_db():
    """
    Provides a database session for dependency injection in web request handlers.

    This generator function creates a new database session for each request,
    yields it for use within the request's scope, and ensures the session
    is always closed afterwards, even if errors occur during the request handling.
    This pattern manages session lifecycles correctly and releases connections
    back to the pool.
