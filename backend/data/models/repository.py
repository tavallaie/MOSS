    Represents a code repository, typically sourced from platforms like GitHub.

    This model stores core metadata about a repository, including its identifiers,
    descriptive information, basic stats, ownership, and technical details like
    language and timestamps. It serves as a central entity linking to contributors,
    discovered DOIs, and potentially other related data like issues or pull requests.

    Inherits common fields like `id`, `created_at`, `updated_at` from `BaseModel`.

    Attributes:
        github_id: The unique numerical ID assigned by GitHub to the repository.
        name: The repository's name (without the owner part).
        full_name: The full name including the owner (e.g., 'owner/name').
        description: The description text provided for the repository.
        homepage: URL of the project's homepage, if provided.
        html_url: URL to the repository's main page on GitHub.
        api_url: URL to the repository's data endpoint in the GitHub API.
        language: The primary programming language detected by GitHub. Indexed.
        default_branch: The name of the default branch (e.g., 'main', 'master').
        stargazers_count: Number of users who have starred the repository.
        watchers_count: Number of users watching (subscribed to notifications for) the repository.
        forks_count: Number of times the repository has been forked.
        open_issues_count: Number of open issues.
        is_fork: Boolean flag indicating if this repository is a fork of another.
        gh_created_at: Timestamp when the repository was created on GitHub.
        gh_updated_at: Timestamp when the repository metadata was last updated on GitHub.
        gh_pushed_at: Timestamp of the last push event to the repository.
        topics: List of topics assigned to the repository on GitHub, stored as JSON.
        license: Information about the repository's license, stored as a JSON object.
        owner_id: Foreign key linking to the Owner (User or Organization) of this repository.
        owner: Relationship back to the Owner object.
        contributors: Many-to-many relationship linking to Contributors via the association table.
        doi_references: One-to-many relationship linking to DOIReference records found within this repository.
