backend.data.models.doi_reference
---------------------------------
This module defines the DOIReference model, which records each instance
where a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is found within a specific file
of a tracked repository. It links the DOI text to the repository and,
potentially, to the resolved scholarly Work it identifies.
