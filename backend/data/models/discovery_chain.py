backend.data.models.discovery_chain

This module defines the DiscoveryChain model, which represents a node in a
provenance graph tracking how various entities (like repositories or works)
were discovered within the system. It forms a hierarchical chain to trace
discovery steps back to their origin.

class DiscoveryChain(Base):
    """
    Represents a single step or node in the discovery provenance graph.

    Each instance tracks a specific discovery action (e.g., finding repositories
    via keyword search, finding DOIs within a repository). It forms a directed
    acyclic graph (DAG) or tree structure through parent/child relationships,
    allowing the system to trace how any discovered entity was found, starting
    from an initial seed or action.

    Uses a UUID primary key as discovery chains might be initiated independently
    and merging them later would be complex with sequential IDs. Does not inherit
    from BaseModel due to the UUID primary key.

    Attributes:
        id: UUID primary key, uniquely identifying this discovery step.
        parent_chain_id: Foreign key to the parent DiscoveryChain node (optional).
        root_chain_id: Foreign key to the ultimate root node of this discovery tree.
        level: Depth of this node in the discovery tree (0 for root nodes).
        discovery_type: String identifying the type of discovery action performed.
        parameters: JSONB field storing parameters used for this discovery step.
        status: Current status of the discovery step (e.g., PENDING, RUNNING, COMPLETED).
        started_at: Timestamp when the discovery process for this node began.
        completed_at: Timestamp when the discovery process for this node finished.
        created_at: Timestamp when this record was created.
        updated_at: Timestamp when this record was last updated.
        parent: Relationship to the parent DiscoveryChain node.
        children: Relationship to child DiscoveryChain nodes initiated from this one.
        entity_associations: Relationship to entities discovered during this step.
