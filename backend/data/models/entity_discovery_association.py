    """
    Association table linking a DiscoveryChain node to a discovered entity.

    This model records the relationship between a specific discovery step (represented
    by a DiscoveryChain node) and a concrete data entity (e.g., a specific Repository,
    Person, Work) identified during that step. It uses a polymorphic approach where
    `entity_type` specifies the kind of entity, and `entity_id` (nullable) points
    to its primary key.

    Inherits common fields like `id`, `created_at`, `updated_at` from `BaseModel`.

    Attributes:
        discovery_chain_id: Foreign key linking to the DiscoveryChain node for this step.
        entity_type: String identifying the type of the discovered entity (e.g., 'Repository', 'Work').
        entity_id: Integer foreign key pointing to the primary key of the discovered entity.
                   This is nullable to accommodate potential entities that might use composite
                   primary keys or cases where the link is conceptual before the entity is fully saved.
        is_direct_discovery: Flag indicating if this entity was directly found by the
                             linked discovery step, or indirectly (e.g., associated via a child step).
        discovery_chain: Relationship back to the DiscoveryChain node.
