    Association table linking Repositories and Contributors (Many-to-Many).

    This model represents the direct link between a repository and a user/bot
    who has contributed to it. It primarily consists of foreign keys forming a
    composite primary key. It can optionally store additional metadata about
    the relationship, such as the number of contributions.

    It inherits directly from `Base` as it uses a composite primary key and
    typically doesn't need separate `id` or standard timestamp columns.

    Attributes:
        repository_id: Foreign key linking to the Repository. Part of the composite PK.
        contributor_id: Foreign key linking to the Contributor. Part of the composite PK.
        contributions_count: Optional field storing the number of contributions made
                             by the contributor to the repository (e.g., from GitHub API).

    # A UniqueConstraint ('uq_repo_contrib') defined here would be redundant because
    # the composite primary key inherently enforces uniqueness on the combination of
    # (repository_id, contributor_id). Therefore, it's typically omitted or
    # commented out for association tables using a composite PK like this.

    # using the `secondary` argument pointing to this table's name. Direct relationships
    # from the association object itself are less common but possible if needed.
