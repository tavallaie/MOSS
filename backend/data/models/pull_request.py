    Represents a GitHub Pull Request linked to a Repository.

    This model stores core information about a GitHub pull request, mirroring
    data retrieved from the GitHub API. It connects the PR to its repository,
    the author (Contributor), and tracks its state (open, closed, merged) and
    key timestamps.

    Inherits common fields like `id`, `created_at`, `updated_at` from `BaseModel`.

    Attributes:
        github_id: The unique numerical ID assigned by GitHub to the pull request.
        repository_id: Foreign key linking to the Repository this PR belongs to.
        user_id: Foreign key linking to the Contributor who opened the PR.
        number: The pull request number, unique within its repository (e.g., #45).
        title: The title text of the pull request.
        state: The current state ('open' or 'closed'). Merged status is indicated by `gh_merged_at`.
        gh_created_at: Timestamp when the PR was created on GitHub.
        gh_updated_at: Timestamp when the PR was last updated on GitHub.
        gh_closed_at: Timestamp when the PR was closed on GitHub (if closed).
        gh_merged_at: Timestamp when the PR was merged on GitHub (if merged).
        repository: Relationship back to the parent Repository object.
        user: Relationship back to the Contributor (author) object.
