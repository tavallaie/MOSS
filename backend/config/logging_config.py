-----------------------------
Centralized logging configuration for the MOSS application.

This module sets up the root logger and provides utilities to configure
log handlers (console, rotating file) and formatters. It supports standard
`RotatingFileHandler` and optionally `ConcurrentRotatingFileHandler` for
multi-process environments if the library is installed.
