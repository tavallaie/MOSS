backend.main
------------

Serves as the main entry point for the MOSS backend FastAPI application.

This module initializes the FastAPI application instance, configures middleware
(like CORS), sets up application-wide logging, defines startup/shutdown event
handlers, includes API routers, and provides basic health check endpoints.

# --- How to Run ---
# To run the development server:
# uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
#
# --reload: Enables auto-reloading when code changes are detected.
# --host 0.0.0.0: Makes the server accessible on the network (not just localhost).
# --port 8000: Specifies the port to listen on.
