    """
    Finds scholarly works that cite repositories affiliated with a specific institution,
    where at least one author of the citing work is also affiliated with that same institution.

    Steps:
    1. Find repositories affiliated with the target institution above a confidence threshold.
    2. Find works cited by DOIs found in those repositories.
    3. Find works that cite the works found in step 2.
    4. Filter these citing works to include only those where at least one author
       has an affiliation record linking them to the target institution.
    5. Return a summary list of these filtered citing works.

    Params:
        - db_conn_str: str (Database connection string)
        - institution_id: int (The internal DB ID of the target institution)
        - min_confidence: float (Minimum confidence score for repository affiliation, default 0.5)

    Returns:
        - Dict[str, Any]: Contains result_type ('table' or 'error') and data.
                         If successful, data is a list of work summary dictionaries.
