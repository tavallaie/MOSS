def calculate_affiliations(

    """
    Identifies potential repository-institution affiliations.

    This algorithm works by:
    1. Finding all persons affiliated with the given `institution_id`.
    2. Identifying all works authored by these affiliated persons.
    3. Locating repositories that contain DOI references pointing to these works.
    4. Aggregating these findings by repository, assigning a predefined
       confidence score, and collecting evidence (the specific works linking
       the repository to the institution's authors).

    Args:
        institution_id: The database ID of the institution to find affiliated
                        repositories for.
        db_conn_str: Database connection string.

    Returns:
        A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a potential
        affiliation found by this algorithm. Each dictionary includes:
        - 'repository_id': The ID of the potentially affiliated repository.
        - 'confidence_score': A fixed score (0.7) indicating the confidence
                              assigned by this specific algorithm.
        - 'evidence': A dictionary detailing the reason for the affiliation,
                      including the signal type and examples of linking works/DOIs.
                      Example:
                      {
                          "signal_type": "affiliated_author_work_reference",
                          "details": [
                              {"type": "affiliated_author_work", "work_id": 123, "doi": "10.xxxx/abc"},
                              ... (up to 5 examples)
                          ]
                      }
        Returns an empty list if no affiliations are found or if an error occurs.
