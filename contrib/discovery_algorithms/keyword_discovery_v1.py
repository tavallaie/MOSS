    Searches GitHub for repositories matching a given set of keywords.

    Constructs a search query from the keywords and uses the GitHubClient
    to perform the search. Handles authentication using a provided API token
    or falls back to anonymous requests (which are heavily rate-limited).

    Args:
        keywords: A list of strings to use as keywords for the GitHub search query.
        max_results: The maximum number of repository URLs to retrieve (default: 100).
        github_api_token: An optional GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) for
                          authenticated API requests, increasing rate limits.
                          If None, anonymous access is used.
        db_conn_str: Database connection string (unused in this function).

    Returns:
        A list of strings, where each string is the HTML URL of a repository
        found matching the keywords. Returns an empty list if no keywords are
        provided, no results are found, or an error occurs during the search.
